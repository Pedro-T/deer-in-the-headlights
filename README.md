## Where To Play
- [On Itch](https://turtlesmock.itch.io/deer-in-the-headlights)

## How To Play
- Move the deer using WASD or the arrow keys
- Your goal is to reach the exit point at the top of the play area
- You lose if the deer is hit by any vehicle.
- There is a twenty second timer. If it expires before you reach the exit, you lose!
- The exit is not available from the start!

## Game Jam Notes
- I'd say this is complete as far as the core intent, which was to create a short frogger-style game with a few additions (locked exit, visibility constraints, time limit)
- I imposed for myself a much shorter time limit than the several weeks given for the jam, to see how far I could get in ~20 hours including relevant learning time.
- I am both a poor artist and a very slow one, so that took a considerable portion of the time allotment for the portions that did not use CC0 or CC-BY assets and definitely constrained the overall scope / polish. This could have been avoided by using more public assets but I did want to get some practice in on that front.

Dropped plans due to time:
- Intro sequence
- Volume adjustment (apologies to those for whom this is too loud or too quiet)
- Title screen artwork was planned to be more interesting
- Hunter animation/sprites completely dropped, which is why he is apparently hiding in a corner-cutting bush
- Mobile support (there is no scaling and no touch support)

## Future Plans
Probably none, though I might pick it up again eventually to finish the dropped components mentioned above.
